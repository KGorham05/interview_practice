# React Challenges

Go to [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/) and select a React template to get started

## Level 1

### Starter Code

```import React from "react";
import "./styles.css";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>0</h1>
      <button>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

* Update the code above so that when the button is clicked, the counter increments. 
* For bonus points, demonstrate this using a class component with setState and also as a functional component using hooks. 

Part 2 (discussion no coding):

* What is the difference between the Real DOM and the Virtual DOM?
* What is React?
* What are the main features of React?
* List some advantages of React.
* What is JSX?
* Why cant browsers read JSX?
* How does the Virtual DOM work? 
* How would you pass data from a class level component to a child component that is not held in state?

These questions and answers can be found [here](https://www.edureka.co/blog/interview-questions/react-interview-questions/).

## Level 2

* Build a product table similar to what can be seen in the [Thinking in React article](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html).
* Pass the data from the parent class level component down to a table component
* Use a loop to display all the table rows
* Filter the table based on user input
* Use the article as a guide
